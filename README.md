# surrogatesPlay
code for our surrogates game with City of Play

## software instructions

### to stream video

#### First! on listening computer run:

```
gst-launch-1.0 udpsrc port=5000 ! gdpdepay ! rtph264depay ! avdec_h264 ! videoconvert ! videoflip method=rotate-180 ! autovideosink sync=false
```

for windows there are some scripts that will run this for you: winServerAutorestart.ahk and wiggle.ahk which prevents screensaver by simulating mouse wiggle

TODO get another pi and just use that for the listening computer

#### Second! on RPi run:

```
gst-launch-1.0 rpicamsrc bitrate=1000000 ! 'video/x-h264,width=640,height=480' ! h264parse ! queue ! rtph264pay config-interval=1 pt=96 ! gdppay ! udpsink host=192.168.0.100 port=5000
```

TODO automate this in the script for the listening computer with SSH into the surrogate

### to stream audio

we use a murmur server on the pi and mumble clients on each device

TODO make the client autostart and join the server on the pi at system start

1: Using this lav, we actually had to cut off one of the mics and wire our own base; the base of this one is a TRRS and the USB sound adapter we had, as linked above, could not use that device as a mic. (It is probably a TRRS, and unusual to a standard jack, because it is a stereo mic.) Ultimately, we cut the TRS jack off of another cable and soldered the single lav mic to it.
